        The most amazing lesson in aerodynamics I ever had was the day I climbed
        a thermal in a glider at the same time as an eagle. I witnessed, close
        up, effortlessness and lightness combined with strength, precision and
        determination

        God created us with an overwhelming desire to soar. Our desire to
        develop and use every ounce of potential He’s placed in us is not
        egotistical. He designed us to be tremendously productive and “to mount
        up with wings like eagles,” realistically dreaming of what He can do
        with our potential.

        My parents always wanted me to do the right thing. My mom, I think her
        exact words were, 'You're not a chicken in the coop playing in the
        scraps, you're an eagle.' I was like, 'Oh, OK... ' But really, I've used
        that throughout my life.
